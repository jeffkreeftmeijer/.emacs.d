#+title: Customizing Emacs' Modus themes

The [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][Modus themes]] are a set of beautiful and customizable themes, which are shipped with Emacs since version 28.

They consist of two types: Modus Operandi is a light theme, and Modus Vivendi is its dark counterpart.
The tinted variants shift the background colors from white and black to a more pleasant light ochre and dark blue.

Select =modus-operandi-tinted= as the default theme:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref theme-init
  (load-theme 'modus-operandi-tinted)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
