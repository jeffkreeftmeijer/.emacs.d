#+title: Magit: an Emacs interface for working with Git repositories

[[https://magit.vc][Magit]] is the most comfortable way to use Git.[fn:magit]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
#+end_src

[fn:magit] I'm quite comfortable with Git's CLI in the terminal, so I held off on isntalling Magit even though I've used (and loved) it in the past.
Now, since I'm working on switching from running Emacs in the terminal to running a terminal in Emacs, I ran into the fact that Eshell can't handle Git's interactive modes because it's a dumb terminal.
