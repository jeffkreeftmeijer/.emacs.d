#+title: Update Emacs to the latest HEAD every week

Since I'm building Emacs from scratch, I might as well take the latest version from the /master/ branch.

My Emacs configuration is stored on Github and managed via Nix, so it's built with locked versions that are in a file I periodically fetch when rebuilding.
I might not fetch the latest version of the configuration repository every week, which would mean I'm behind on these lock files.
However, if I do update, I do so in weekly iterations which saves on build time.

This workflow updates the lock file on my Emacs configuration repository every friday at midnight:[fn:friday]

#+headers: :tangle .github/workflows/update-lock.yml
#+begin_src yaml
  name: Update lock file

  on:
    schedule:
      - cron: '0 0 * * 5'
    workflow_dispatch:

  jobs:
    update-lock:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      permissions:
        contents: write

      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v19
        - run: nix flake update
        - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
          with:
            commit_message: Update flake.lock
#+end_src

[fn:friday] Friday was chosen because it's most likely to be recently updated when I decide to fetch the lock files and rebuild.
